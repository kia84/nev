Templates for nevendaar.com site
================================

This is tool kit for easy template creation and management.

Site powered by uCoz, so we have a lot of restrictions,
but here we can avoid some of them.

We still able to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, uCoz "conditional statement",
but now we can also use:

* eRuby (ERB)
* custom layouts, partials - to avoid code duplication
* custom helpers
* one config file for all our templates
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) - for pretty stylesheets
* file for deprecated uCoz codes - to get more cleaner code
